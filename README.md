# PixelNest Documentation

## Short Description

PixelNest is a web application that is still under development. Purpose of this application is because I wanted to expand my knowledge of Angular and ASP.NET.
For storing data I used MSSQL.

This application should be similar to the Instagram.
Every user that wants to try this application will have two options, one is to make his account or continue as guest.

Registered users will have ability to create new posts, like, comment aswell as save posts that they like. 
Also each user will be able to follow other users and chat with them.

### For now in early stages users can only register, login, create and like posts.

Above given features are in plan and will be implemented in near future.
